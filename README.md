# Micro Tech Kit

This repository hosts the files and tutorials for all M.T.K. kits and is designed for electronics beginers! We are currently in the process of:

- Designing Kits
- Coding Example Code
- Ordering Kit Parts
- Shipping Kits

## Why are we doing this?

We want all who want to get into electronics to be able to get a starting point and be able to have the resources they need!

## Types of kits:

- Full Kits
  - A kit that contains all necacerry parts (exept a computer of course).
- Lite Kits
  - Kits that contain the parts to go along with the microcontroler/rasperry pi to save money if you already have the brain
- Compute Kits
  - Kits that contain a microcontroler/rasperry pi and necessary accesories for that microcontroler/rasperry pi.
- Tool Kits
  - Kits that contain tools for other kits and your own projects!
